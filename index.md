# <u> E-Portfolio </u>

## Welcome
Hello my name is Derek Clark and welcome to my E-portfolio. The purpose of this E-portfolio is to not only demonstrate my ability to develop a fully fledged working application but identify weaknesses and imporvements that can be made to enhance the artifact.  Encompassed in this portfolio are three unqiue artifacts that fall under three distinct software development categories. These three distinct categories are _Software Design & Engineering_ , _Algorithms & Data Structures_ , and lastly _Databases_. 

Additionally, I have included a [**_code review video_**](#Code-Review) that was recorded prior to the enhanced works completion detailing the planned enhancement and how it will imrove the application.

In the next section of the E-portfolio I have decided to include a professional self assesment reflecting on the work I have done to complete this capstone project and my experience in the computer science program at SNHU.

## Professional Self Assesment
Completing the coursework throughout the SNHU computer science curriculum has allowed me to develop artifacts in which I can use to support my technological abilities including the use of relevant tools and practices that are commonly utilized in the software development field . Developing this E-portfolio has allowed me to take these previous works, showcase the work done, and reflect on the changes made to enhance them. Reviewing and reflecting upon past work during the construction of this E-Portfolio has granted me the opportunity to identify flaws, vulnerabilities, and weaknesses within these past works that I may have not previously been aware of. Throughout the SNHU computer science program I had the opportunity to work on many projects that involved developing solutions for real world problems both individually and as a group. Through developing these projects I have discovered many core software development principles and values such as gaining a deeper appreciation for the planning and testing phases of the software development life cycle and learning how to effectively gather user feedback to generate user-centric designs. My experience with full stack web development, databases, android development, and agile methodologies have prepared me to contribute meaningfully in various computer science related fields. 

Throughout my time at SNHU I developed projects utilizing different tech stacks and languages which allowed me to not only understand them individually but understand how to program down to the fundamentals. For example, in my data structures and algorithms course I had created various projects utilizing c++ in which I had to extract data from CSV files, insert the relevant data into the appropriate data structure, and perform operations on the data such as querying, sorting, and updating. Although this course only had us develop these projects utilizing c++ the course had given me the fundamental base knowledge of the different types of data structures, what their benefits and weaknesses are, and the understanding of time/space complexities which will benefit me in any job that involves managing data efficiently and identifying optimal computing solutions. 

On the non technical side I also developed soft skills throughout the SNHU computer science program like effective communication, teamwork, and how to properly collect user feedback. One example in which I had to collaborate with a team and communicate with stakeholders was during my enrollment in the Software Development Lifecycle course. Participating in this course meant that I would have to work with a team of peers to develop a 



## Code Review

Code reviews are an important and common practice in the field of software development allowing for a deeper more thruough look through of the code to identify possible weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and ways in which the code can be improved. The following code review video was performed by me identifying enhancements that can be made to the three artifacts included in this E-portfolio, why I have chosen the enhancements/how the enhancement will improve the artifact, and finally what are my plans for implementing the planned enhancements. The code review video demonstrates my growth as a software developer and my ability to aknowledge my own faults and improve upon them with my new found knowledge.
